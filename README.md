- 👋 Hi, I’m @ericnel
- 👀 I hang out mainly on Atlassian Bitbucket (server and cloud) but tinker in github from time to time.
- 🌱 I previously worked for 16 years at Microsoft as an architect and evangelist.
- 💞️ I thank all the github contributors for helping me and my customers over the years.
- 📫 You can find me at www.ericnelson.co.uk
